After eight plus years of keeping a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site I
am finally throwing in the towel. I am really tired of having to do the whole
maintenance cycle on a complex blogging software application for a site that I
don't really update all that often. So I have decided to migrate over to
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I will try to import the relevant articles and comments into this site at some
point.
